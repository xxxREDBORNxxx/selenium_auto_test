Task: waiting for the desired text on the page

The program will book us a holiday home at a strictly set price.

- Open the page http://suninjuly .github.io/explicit_wait2.html
- Wait for the price of the house to decrease to $100 (waiting must be set for at least 12 seconds)
- Click on the "Book" button
- Solve a mathematical problem already known to us (use previously written code) and send the solution
- To determine the moment when the rental price will decrease to $100,
use the text_to_be_present_in_element method from the expected_conditions library.
